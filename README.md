## Book Followed 
Object oriented By E balagurusamy

Day  1 Principles of Object Oriented programming

### Procedural Programming
- In POP it consists of writing a list of instructions for computer to follow and organise these instructions into groups known as Functions.
- Important data item are placed as Global so that they may accessed by all functions. Therefore data is vulnerable.
- Doesn't model real world problem well, Doesn't incorporates real world entity.
- Functions are action-oriented.
- POP Features
  - Emphasis on algo
  - Divide into functions.
  - Share global data
  - Data move freely
  - Follows top down

### Object Oriented Programming
- OOPS a paradigm in which we divide our problems into entities called Objects and then build data and function around these objects.
- Alternatively, It is a way of modularizing programs by creating a partitioned memory area for data and function that are enclosed together in a class and can create copies of such modules on demand
- OOPS Features
  - Emphasis on data rather functions.
  - Programs divided into objects.
  - Functions that operate on it will be tied together in data structure
  - data is hidden by using access modiifers.
  - Follows bootom up 
  - Objects can communicate.
 - #### Class - Class is a user defined data type which is basically a blueprint that shares same characteristics(data) or behaviour(function) that is common to all objects. It is group of variables of different types. Class doesn't occupy memory.
 - #### Objects - Run time entity that have state(data members), behaviour(member function),id(unique id)
 - #### Encapsulation - Wrapping up of data and function into a single unit is known as encapsualtion. Data is not accessible to outside world.
 - #### Abstraction - It refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanation.
 - #### Inheritance - Objects of one class derive the properties of object of other class.
 - #### Polymorphism - Ability of a function and operator to take more than form. An Operation may exhibit different behaviour in different instances. The behaviour depends upon the types of data used in operation.
 - #### Dynamic Binding - Binding refers to the linking of procedure call to the code to be executed in reponse to the call. Dynamic binding means that code associated with a given procedure call is not known untill the time of the call at run time. It is associated to polymorphishm and inheritance.
 - #### Message Passing - Objects communicate with one other by sending and receiving info.It specifies the name of object and name of function and information(arguments) to be sent.
 
 - Object based programming supports encapsulation and object identity(ex ada) while oops has inheritance + dynamic binding as well(ex C++)
 
 
 
 - Day 2 (Beginning with c++)
 
 - Developed by Bjarne stroustrap
 - c++ superset of c
 - All c programs are c++ programs but vice versa not true and maybe some c program not work under c++ compiler
 - Applications of C++:-
   - Allows to make object oriented libraries that can use later.
   - C++ map real world problems while its part c gives more ability to machine level details.
 - << is insertion or put to operator. where >> is extraction or get to operator.
 - Namespace provide the space or scope where we can define or declare identifier i.e. variable,  method, classes.
   - Example, you might be writing some code that has a function called xyz() and there is another library available which is also having same function xyz(). Now the compiler has no way of knowing which version of xyz() function you are referring to within your code.
 - In C Namespace,Refrence variable,virtual and friend function not supported and no strict type checking.
 - main function should have a return type as zero to avoid warnings or errors.
 - Default return type for all functio in c++ is int.
 - cin can read only name without spaces.
