## Book Followed 
Object oriented By E balagurusamy

Day  1 Principles of Object Oriented programming

### Procedural Programming
- In POP it consists of writing a list of instructions for computer to follow and organise these instructions into groups known as Functions.
- Important data item are placed as Global so that they may accessed by all functions. Therefore data is vulnerable.
- Doesn't model real world problem well, Doesn't incorporates real world entity.
- Functions are action-oriented.
- POP Features
  - Emphasis on algo
  - Divide into functions.
  - Share global data
  - Data move freely
  - Follows top down

### Object Oriented Programming
- OOPS a paradigm in which we divide our problems into entities called Objects and then build data and function around these objects.
- Alternatively, It is a way of modularizing programs by creating a partitioned memory area for data and function that are enclosed together in a class and can create copies of such modules on demand
- OOPS Features
  - Emphasis on data rather functions.
  - Programs divided into objects.
  - Functions that operate on it will be tied together in data structure
  - data is hidden by using access modiifers.
  - Follows bootom up 
  - Objects can communicate.
 - ### Class - Class is a user defined data type which is basically a blueprint that shares same characteristics(data) or behaviour(function) that is common to all objects. It is group of variables of different types. Class doesn't occupy memory.
 - ### Objects - Run time entity that have state(data members), behaviour(member function),id(unique id)
 - ### Encapsulation - Wrapping up of data and function into a single unit is known as encapsualtion. Data is not accessible to outside world.
 - ### Abstraction - It refers to the act of representing essential features without including the background details or explanation.
 - ### Inheritance - Objects of one class derive the properties of object of other class.
 - ### Polymorphism - Ability of a function and operator to take more than form. An Operation may exhibit different behaviour in different instances. The behaviour depends upon the types of data used in operation.
 - ### Dynamic Binding - Binding refers to the linking of procedure call to the code to be executed in reponse to the call. Dynamic binding means that code associated with a given procedure call is not known untill the time of the call at run time. It is associated to polymorphishm and inheritance.
 - ### Message Passing - Objects communicate with one other by sending and receiving info.It specifies the name of object and name of function and information(arguments) to be sent.
